# aws-cicd-demo-python-app

A Python containerization fixture that consumes
[aws-cicd-framework](https://github.com/loriamichaelj/aws-cicd-framework).

This repository carries **no functional application logic, by design**. It exists to give
the framework's build, lint, and containerization steps a real artifact to operate on.

`main` is the default branch and holds this README plus the `.github/workflows/` files —
not the deliverable itself (no Dockerfile, source, or tests here). The workflow files are
present only because GitHub requires a `workflow_dispatch` workflow to exist on the
default branch to be manually triggerable at all, even when you then run a different
branch's version of it via the branch selector. The actual Dockerfile, source, and tests
live on the `dev`/`stage`/`prod` branches.

## Branches

| Branch | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `main` | This README only. Entry point, signpost, and GitHub default branch. |
| `dev` | Active development. Push here auto-deploys to the `dev` environment. |
| `stage` | PR-merge here deploys to the `stage` environment, behind a required reviewer. |
| `prod` | PR-merge here deploys to the `prod` environment, behind a required reviewer. |
